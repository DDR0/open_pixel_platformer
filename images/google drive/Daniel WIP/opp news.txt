Open Pixel Platformer is back!

For those of you who don't remember, in May 2013 we started the Open Pixel Platformer, a game collaboration project hosted at PJ. Due to a server crash and lack of time to solve that, the project slowly broke down.

I have always been amazed by how much high quality tiles and sprites we have created together so quickly. Now finally, with our wiki -LINK- updated and back online, it's time to work on it again! 

Lets make some art and give it away to the game developers community!

What is the OPP?

This is a collaboratively created, open licensed (CC-BY -LINK-) platform sprite and tileset package. Among all the small or low quality sets available, it is time to show off what we can do and create a set that people will be proud to use! Also, if we are lucky we might be able to create a demo or real game ourselves, two years ago the developers from Frogatto among others, were teaming up with us to realize this!

We have been using Dawnbringers DB32 palette -LINK- and a style guide -LINK- to make everything cohesive.
