Hi

Hapiel here, from the Open Pixel Platformer project

Some time ago, you submitted artwork to the project, here at PixelJoint, which was licensed CC-BY 3.0.

It turns out, CC-BY license is not as flexible as we had assumed when the project started.
For several reasons, most importantly the ability to relicense the assets to anything that suits the user, we want to put all of the OPP content in the public domain. This means that anyone could use the assets for anything, no strings attached.

Would you agree to put the images you've contributed to the project in the public domain? Please let me know!
If not, or if we don't hear from you, we might need to remove your assets in future packages of the project :(

For more information on what the licenses mean and why we are changing it, check out this forum post: [url]http://www.pixeljoint.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=22841[/url]

Thanks a lot for your contributions, and thanks in advance for your reply!
Kind regards, and see you around at the forums :)

Hapiel
