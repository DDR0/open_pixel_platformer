OPP-atar AKA Oddly Proportioned People - atar

It looks like the OPP is making some good progress at the moment. Tilesets have been created, edited and characters and enemies imagined into
glorious life. I don't think we could have wished for any more from the community so far :) I feel that I've contributed to that in some small 
way I guess, not as much as I could, cause I always seem to get sidetracked. Look a squirrel!(Linked to squirrel vid) Ok, I can't help myslef, 
really, and in this case, it seems I'm messing around with avatars.

So what are we doing in this thread? Well, we're being vein mostly and because I personally loving the OPP's simple character design and style,
thought, hell, this project needs more of, well, ME! And you, of couse some more of YOU! So thats what we're doing here, we're going to create 
some avatars of ourselves in OPP style! 

Here's are the -RULES- Guidlines
